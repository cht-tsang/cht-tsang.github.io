      <h2>Job Title: Programmer</h2>
      <p>A graduate from the Full-Stack program of the coding bootcamp, Le Wagon. An experience I would recommend to
        anyone, even if you don't know any coding! You will learn so much in 9 weeks just as I did starting from no
        knowledge at all!</p>
      <p>
        Since I am also a graduate in Film & TV studies, there is almost no film I won't watch as I love watching films
        of all genres.
        I am also a big fan of watching anime. My favourite is <strong>One piece</strong>! Seemingly endless, always
        adventurous and hilariously amusing, I can't help but follow Luffy and his pirate crew.
      </p>
      <p>I also enjoy watching <strong>MMA</strong> as well. My favourite fighter to watch is Max Holloway.</p>
